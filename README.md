This tutorial provided a basic example of creating a ticket, assigning it, and resolving it, showcasing communication between agents. In practice, tickets may also be reassigned to different departments, escalated in severity, or transferred to more qualified agents based on business impacts. Help desk agents can handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets daily, depending on the company's size. This overview aims to give you a better understanding of the ticket life cycle.
